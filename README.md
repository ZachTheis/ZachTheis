## About Me ðŸš€ 
I'm a student at Raritan Valley Community College in my last semester of my AAS in Computer Programming.

I came to programming later in life than I would have liked; believe it or not, my first career choice was in theatre. However with the limited job market in the arts, I decided to break into the industry and discovered that, while I'm only OK at dealing with computer hardware, I have a real knack for coding!

  
## Skills ðŸ›  
### Programming Languages
Java:       Moderate to high proficiency, 1-2 years academic experience
Python:     Moderate proficiency, 1 year academic experience 

### Soft Skills
Team Management: Moderate to high proficiency, 3 years professional experience 
Interpersonal Communication: High proficiency, 10+ years of personal/professional experience


## Hobbies
I've been involved in Live Action Roleplay (LARP) in the NJ/eastern PA area for 15 years, both as a player and as multiple staff positions. I currently run a non-profit game called Neverafter that raises money for the Cancer Hope Network.

Unsurprisingly, I also love D&D, when my gaming group can find time for it.


## Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ± 
### Coding Languages
Javascript
HTML/CSS
Further developing my Java and Python skills

### Hobbies
I've recently started creating props and armor out of EVA foam. I'm still a relative novice at it, but getting better every day! A few works in progress:
